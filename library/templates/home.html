    <p>Release year: 1999</p>
    <p>Description: Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys
        had been so mean and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts
        School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as heâ€™s packing his bags, Harry receives
        a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts,
        disaster will strike.
